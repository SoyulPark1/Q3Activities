		<p class="text-light">Stephen McDannell Hillenburg is the creator of SpongeBob SquarePants (1999), Nickelodeon's highest-rated cartoons for children and a staple of American television. He was born on August 21, 1961 in Fort Sill, a United States Army post in Lawton, Oklahoma, to Nancy (Dufour) Hillenburg and Kelly Neugent Hillenburg Jr.</p>
		<p class="text-light">In the US, SpongeBob SquarePants is a tremendously successful and well-liked animated series. The Intertidal Zone was first conceived in 1989 by Nickelodeon animator Stephen Hillenburg as an unpublished comic book, but it wasn't until 1996 that it was turned into a TV series. SpongeBoy was supposed to be SpongeBob's name, but the name had already been registered as a trademark. In 1999, the series made its debut. The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was released in 2004 as a result of its enormous popularity.</p>
		<p class="text-light">Inhabited by a good-natured pineapple-dwelling yellow sponge and a motley crew of sea creatures, the Nickelodeon TV program gained huge popularity with both children and adults over its nearly 20-year run.</p><head>
